react-big-calendar
========================

An event Calendar component built for React. Inspired by [Full Calendar](http://fullcalendar.io/).

big calendar is built for modern browsers (read: ie10+) and uses flexbox over the classic tables-ception approach.

[__DEMO___](http://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html)

To run the example locally, `git clone`, `npm install` and `npm run examples`, hosted at localhost:3000.
